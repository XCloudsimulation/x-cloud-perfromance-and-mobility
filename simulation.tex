Multiple runs for each DC/\xcloud placement mode.
\begin{description}
\item[Service]
The traffic generated by and the usage pattern of a simple web application is characteristic of any smaller mobile application. The HTTP traffic model in \cite{liu2001traffic} provides a small scale closed loop traffic model that is representative of light mobile traffic.

\item[Mobility]
The 2 dimensional, multi model, mobility model \cite{bettstetter2001smooth} will provide the uniform mobile network with an relevant distribution of users.

\item[Mobile Access Network] Provided by Williams SIMJava framework. Handover are instantanious and move 

\item[Core network] No delay, no routeing

\item[Server] The server provides VM and DC models that encompass, inucrred VM migration performance degredation in DC and in VM, resulting in a different service time.

Possible service hosting schemes:
\begin{itemize}
\item One service model, one VM is empolyed to host that service for each user.
\item One service model, each VM hosts multiple but each number of users, behaving as multiple services while still being compatible.
\end{itemize}

\end{description}

At all placement modes:
\begin{itemize}
\item Measure RTT for all packetc at UE
\item Measure DC load
\item Measure ratio of requests generated vs. processed in \xcloud node
\item Identify the incurred VM migration load
\end{itemize}
