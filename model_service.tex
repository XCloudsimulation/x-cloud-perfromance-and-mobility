\subsection{Service}
Most mobile applications use HTTP as a means to communicate with remote services, often through a web interface \cite{maier2010first,falaki2010first}. We will model our service application to that of a stateless web service catering to the subscribers in the local network. The HTTP traffic model in \cite{liu2001traffic} provides an open loop traffic model with a long tailed session size distribution, representative of the diversity of mobile the requests. 

Each session is separated in time with a poisson process of $\lambda_{ses}$. Each sessions produces $N_{req}$, sampled from an inverse Gaussian distribution, where each request is separated in time by log-normal distributed delay $D_{req}$.

Each service adheres to the same properties, and are only distinguished by the VM in which they are running. Additionally, the properties of the service model are independent of \ue{} state and mobility mode.
