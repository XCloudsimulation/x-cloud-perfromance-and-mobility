\subsection{Mobile access network}
The mobile network is composed of $N_{rbs}$ radio base stations equidistantly distributed within the domain of the network. A \ue{} is handed over between base stations at the point where they cross the cell boundary distinguishing two independent radio base stations defined by the width of the rectangular cells $d_{rbs}$. The mobile access network model does take into account the physical layer, channel provisioning, and cell load balancing. Additionally, the radio access network functions as a mechanism to associate \ues{} with \dcs{}, propagation and system processing delays are thus not modelled.
