\subsection{Core network}
The core network is modelled with a Weibull delay $T_{net}$ in multiples of the number of network nodes between the source and the destination, in accordance with \cite{papagiannaki2003measurement}. The distance between \rbss{} is equal to the cell dimension $d_{rbs}$. Associated \rbss{} are equidestant to their common \dc{}.
