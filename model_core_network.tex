\subsection{Core network}
The delay induced by the core network is modelled with a Weibull delay $T_{net}$ in multiples of the number of network nodes between the source and the destination, in accordance with \cite{papagiannaki2003measurement}. The distance between \ac{RBS}s is equal to the cell dimension $d_{rbs}$. Associated \ac{DC}s are equidestant to their common \sc{DC}, and are for the sake of simplicity assumed to be separated by one router.
