\subsection{VM migration schemes}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Precopy} --- the whole memory of VM is copied preemptively before switching the execution to the new \dc{}.
\item \textbf{Postcopy} --- the memory of VM is copied after switching the execution to the new \dc{} as is needed to serve the incoming requests.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{VM placement and \dc{} provisioning schemes}
To understand the effects of various migration schemes on the \dc and service performance, the following migration schemes were deployed:

\begin{itemize}
\item A VM for service $S_j$, if active, residec in the \dc with the largest number of subscribers. If this criteria were to change the the hosting VM will migrate to the resulting \dc.
\item Each \dc that hosts a \ue that subscribes to $S_j$ hosts an instance of a service $S_j$ VM. If users disperse, the VM for service $S_j$ will duplicat to the receiving \dc.
\end{itemize}

Differentiation between short term jobs (online processing) and long term (offline processing after upload, getting statistics, big data)

Use different service models or change parameters of distributions in current one.
Model specific applications (youtube like, facebook like, etc.) and compare them, or show implications of different abstract and extreme configurations.
