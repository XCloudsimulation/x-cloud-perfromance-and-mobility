However for migration to be useful, deployable feature on a large (datacentre) scale, we need to predict migration times with accuracy. In this paper, we characterise the parameters affecting live migration with particular emphasis on the Xen virtualisation platform. We discuss the relationships between the important parameters that affect migration and highlight how migration performance can vary considerably depending on the workload. We further provide 2 simulation models that are able to predict migration times to within 90% accuracy for both synthetic and real-world benchmarks.},

  Abstract                 = {The current growth in embedded ICT infrastructure, driven by visions such as the "Smart Cities" concept, is leading to the deployment of a wide range of embedded systems in our environment, which motivates the need for a reusable, flexible and manageable Wireless Sensor Network or WSN infrastructure. However, to simplify the system operation and maintenance as well as to reduce costs, WSNs mus become an infrastructure that is capable of providing services to multiple end users concurrently, rather than having to roll out individual infrastructures for specific purposes. Here, we present the concept of a WSN infrastructure as a WSN Cloud, which provides services to multiple application and data collection systems which adheres to the cloud computing paradigm. Each instance of the WSN Cloud (i.e. a specific set of services configured by a particular end user/system) utilises the WSN infrastructure as if it was a unique network provisioned for their specific requirements. This realisation of the WSN Cloud as Network as a Service or NaaS requires the WSN to support a service orientated software architecture allowing other systems to provision the WSN infrastructure for their needs with NaaS allowing multiple systems to use the WSN uniquely and concurrently. The WSN-Service Orchestration Architecture "WSN-SOrA" presented here is a novel approach to orchestrate service provisioning for embedded networked systems, and enables WSNs to act as cloud ready infrastructures that facilitate on-demand provisioning for potentially multiple individual backend systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Network as a Service (NaaS) is recently becoming increasingly relevant, as it will enable cloud providers to select on-demand network services according to application needs. Currently, the lack of QoS control over cloud networking services may significantly impact the application performance. Therefore, two important issues should be addressed by the NaaS providers: (i) determining the QoS to be provided by each cloud networking service, (ii) supporting advanced services differentiation to ensure application flow requirements. In this paper, we present a modeling of QoS-aware cloud networking services and we propose a class of service (CoS) classification to deal with flow cloud application requirements.},

Several use cases illustrating the requirements of Mobile-Cloud Networking and its applications in terms of end-to-end Enriched Connectivity are given. Likewise, a functional mapping of the proposed framework on the Evolved Packet System (EPS) architecture is presented with an open well-defined Application Programming Interface (API) to handle this Enriched Connectivity.},

In this work we study TCP performance independent of the type of network by considering the different possible characteristics of the connection path. We present the problems and the different proposed solutions.

The arrival process of HTTP requests is assumed to be Poissonian and the service discipline is processor sharing. The total number of requests that can be processed at one time was limited to K. Closed form expressions were obtained for web server performance metrics such as average response time, throughput and blocking probability. The average of the service time requirement and the limit of the number of requests being served were model parameters. The parameters were estimated by maximizing the log-likelihood function of the measured average response time. Compared to other models, this model is conceptually simple and it is easy to estimate model parameters. The model had been validated through lab measurements. The performance metrics predicted by the model fit well to the experimental outcome.},

  Abstract                 = {Distributed computing is a very broad and active research area comprising fields such as cluster computing, computational grids, desktop grids and peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. Unfortunately, it is often impossible to obtain theoretical or analytical results to compare the performance of algorithms targeting such systems. One possibility is to conduct large numbers of back-to-back experiments on real platforms. While this is possible on tightly-coupled platforms, it is infeasible on modern distributed platforms as experiments are labor-intensive and results typically not reproducible. Consequently, one must resort to simulations, which enable reproducible results and also make it possible to explore wide ranges of platform and application scenarios. In this paper we describe the SimGrid framework, a simulation-based framework for evaluating cluster, grid and P2P algorithms and heuristics. This paper focuses on SimGrid v3, which greatly improves on previous versions thanks to a novel and validated modular simulation engine that achieves higher simulation speed without hindering simulation accuracy. Also, two new user interfaces were added to broaden the targeted research community. After surveying existing tools and methodologies we describe the key features and benefits of SimGrid.},

  Abstract                 = {CPU and device virtualization technology allows applications to be hosted on cloud platforms; some of the resulting benefits are lower cost and greater elasticity. In such cloud hosted applications, some components reside on the cloud while others, such as end users and components tied to physical devices, are located outside the cloud. Many applications, e.g., telecom services, have stringent latency requirements in terms of within how much time certain procedures must be completed. The application latency is strongly determined by the locations of all the interacting components that are both within and outside the cloud. In this paper, we study the problem of determining the optimal placement of the application components in the cloud so that the latency requirements of the application can be met. We present a precise formulation of the placement problem which includes a specification of the cloud platform, and collective latency expressions for application-level latency requirements. We show that Message Sequence Charts (MSCs), a widely-used mechanism for describing the execution of application procedures, can be naturally translated into our formalism of collective latency expressions. We present placement algorithms that exploit the Euclidean triangular inequality property of network topologies: (a) an exact algorithm for determining the most optimal placement but which has a worst-case exponential running time, and (b) an algorithm for determining a close to-optimal placement that has a fast polynomial running time. Additionally, we present an exact technique for partitioning a placement problem into smaller sub problems so that greater efficiency and accuracy can be achieved. We evaluate the performance of the algorithms on a representative telecom application --- a distributed deployment of the LTE Mobility Management Entity (MME). Our evaluation results show that our approximate algorithm can outperform a random placement by up to 49% for finding a success- ul placement.},

  Abstract                 = {The Cloud Networking(CloNe) infrastructure provisions elastic, secure, and on-demand virtualized network resources to the end user. It incorporates the Network-as-a-Service(NaaS) provisioning model, which enhances network-level scalability, throughput, and performance. In this paper, we extend the CloNe architecture by designing, deploying, and integrating an identity management framework, customized for the CloNe infrastructure. The identity management framework proposed in this paper, is based on the User Managed Access(UMA) protocol. The framework supports authentication, authorization, and identity management of entities in the CloNe infrastructure. Furthermore it enables federated identity management and management of access control policies across different infrastructure providers.},

  Abstract                 = {The crucial role that networking plays in Cloud computing calls for a holistic vision that allows combined control, management, and optimization of both networking and computing resources in a Cloud environment, which leads to a convergence of networking and Cloud computing. Network virtualization is being adopted in both telecommunications and the Internet as a key attribute for the next generation networking. Virtualization, as a potential enabler of profound changes in both communications and computing domains, is expected to bridge the gap between these two fields. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA), when applied in network virtualization, enables a Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) paradigm that may greatly facilitate the convergence of networking and Cloud computing. Recently the application of SOA in network virtualization has attracted extensive interest from both academia and industry. Although numerous relevant research works have been published, they are currently scattered across multiple fields in the literature, including telecommunications, computer networking, Web services, and Cloud computing. In this article we present a comprehensive survey on the latest developments in service-oriented network virtualization for supporting Cloud computing, particularly from a perspective of network and Cloud convergence through NaaS. Specifically, we first introduce the SOA principle and review recent research progress on applying SOA to support network virtualization in both telecommunications and the Internet. Then we present a framework of network-Cloud convergence based on service-oriented network virtualization and give a survey on key technologies for realizing NaaS, mainly focusing on state of the art of network service description, discovery, and composition. We also discuss the challenges brought in by network-Cloud convergence to these technologies and research opportunities available in these areas, with a hope to arouse the research community's interest - n this emerging interdisciplinary field.},

In this work, we present a tool, called OpenAirInterface Traffic Generator (OTG), for the generation of realistic application traffic that can be used for testing and evaluating the performance of emerging networking architectures. In addition to the traffic of conventional applications, OTG is capable of accurately emulating the traffic of new application scenarios such as online gaming and machine-type communication. To highlight the capability and new features of the tool, the one-way delay of OpenArena online gaming application in the presence of the background traffic is analyzed over the LTE network using OpenAirInterface emulation platform.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose a link layer design for mobile hotspots. We design a novel system architecture that enables high-speed Internet access in railway systems. The proposed design uses a number of repeaters placed along the track and multiple antennas installed on the roof of a vehicle. Each packet is decomposed into smaller fragments and relayed to the vehicle via adjacent repeaters. We also use erasure coding to add parity fragments to original data. This approach is called information raining since fragments are rained upon the vehicle from adjacent repeaters. We investigate two instances of information raining. In blind information raining, all repeaters awaken when they sense the presence of the vehicle. The fragments are then blindly transmitted via awakened repeaters. A vehicle station installed inside the train is responsible for aggregating a large enough number of fragments. In the throughput-optimized information raining, the vehicle station selects a bipartite matching between repeaters and roof-top antennas and activates only a subset of the repeaters. It also dictates the amount of transmission power of each activated repeater. Both the bipartite matching and power allocations are individually shown to be NP-complete. Matching heuristics based on the Hungarian algorithm and Gale-Shapley algorithm are proposed. A simplex-type algorithm is proposed as the power allocation heuristics.},

The outburst of executions of live migration operations can deteriorate migration performance and make it difficult to provide required resources to users in a timely manner. Therefore, understanding the behaviors and the performance of simultaneous live migrations is very important to provide efficient and reliable cloud computing services. In this paper, we construct a performance model of concurrent live migrations in virtualized datacenters. We first collect performance data from an experimental virtualized system in which we execute simultaneous live migrations. Based on the data, we next construct a performance model representing the performance characteristics of live migration using PRISM, a probabilistic model checker. We then demonstrate that we can easily verify the properties described in PRISM language regarding live migration performance using this model.},

Although mobile devices capacity in storing data and running computational process is very limited, the main problem for implementing mobile cloud computing environment is still motivated by the classic issue of information properties query process. Heterogeneous wireless networks (HWNs) architecture then exploited to solve this fundamental problem. The HWNs information properties dispersion model based on coverage area of mobile node aid to simplify the querying process. By HWN and mobile P2P integration a reliable mobile cloud computing service can perform services and resources exchange among peer nodes. In addition this integrated architecture gives the extension of mobile P2P into Network as a Service (NaaS) approach to resource sharing among mobile users.},

  Abstract                 = {Performance and power issues are becoming increasingly important in the design of large, cluster-based multi-tier data centers for supporting a multitude of services. The design and analysis of such large/complex distributed systems often suffer from the lack of availability of an adequate physical infrastructure. This paper presents a comprehensive, flexible, and scalable simulation platform for in-depth analysis of multi-tier data centers. Designed as a pluggable three-level architecture, our simulator captures all the important design specifics of the underlying communication paradigm, kernel level scheduling artifacts, and the application level interactions among the tiers of a three-tier data center. The flexibility of the simulator is attributed to its ability in experimenting with different design alternatives in the three layers, and in analyzing both the performance and power consumption with realistic workloads. The scalability of the simulator is demonstrated with analyses of different data center configurations. In addition, we have designed a prototype three-tier data center on an Infiniband Architecture (IBA) connected Linux cluster to validate the simulator. Using RUBiS benchmark workload, it is shown that the simulator is quite accurate in estimating the throughput, response time, and power consumption. We then demonstrate the applicability of the simulator in conducting three different types of studies. First, we conduct a comparative analysis of the IBA and 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 GigE) under different traffic conditions and with varying size clusters for understanding their relative merits in designing cluster-based servers. Second, measurement and characterization of power consumption across the servers of a three-tier data center is done. Third, we perform a configuration analysis of the Web server (WS), Application Server (AS), and Database Server (DB) for performance optimization. We believe that such a comprehensive simulation infrastructure - is critical for providing guidelines in designing efficient and cost-effective multi-tier data centers.},

The proposed allocation utilizes an estimation of the current congestion window of TCP connections to allocate resources so that vulnerable flows with small congestion windows avoid entering packet recovery via retransmission time out. In addition, for the long-lived TCP flows, the theoretical TCP throughput which can be accomplished in their end-to-end path is used as their desired achievable data rate on wireless link. Such a technique can be of significant importance since due to its popularity, TCP is commonly used over the broadband wireless networks.},

  Abstract                 = {The telecom networks have undergone a massive transformation in last few decades from all-voice circuit-switched network to all-IP packet-switched network that is converging voice and data worlds. The evolution of the telecom networks have also driven the evolution of Service Delivery Platforms (SDP) from in-flexible single-box solution to a flexible, modular SOA governed SDP to cater the ever changing business needs of the Telcos. The fourth generation SDP is taking shape around cloud computing with an expectation to significantly reduce OPEX and CAPEX, and boost the revenue. But this is not happening because in the current scenario where SDPs are hosted on private cloud in Telcos' own premises prohibit sharing and reuse. So Telcos have started transitioning to a hosted model in which VAS applications are hosted in SDP vendor's premises in public cloud. Hosting telecom services in public cloud has its unique challenges, and one of the most important is to provide a multi-tenant telecom application to all Telcos, where each tenant sees an isolated view of the application with his own set of customized features. In this paper we have identified the factors that are stopping us from introducing true customized multi-tenancy in telecom apps and proposed a solution to this problem. We have presented a variant of cloud's SaaS layer called Telecom-SaaS (TSaaS) for telecom public cloud, which introduces a TSaaS-engine to drive the multi-tenancy for carrier grade telecom applications outside the actual business logic. New business models that can evolve around this new architecture are also identified. We have also highlighted the associated risks to watch out for.},

  Abstract                 = {Long-term evolution (LTE) represents an emerging and promising technology for providing broadband ubiquitous Internet access. For this reason, several research groups are trying to optimize its performance. Unfortunately, at present, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source simulation platforms, which the scientific community can use to evaluate the performance of the entire LTE system, are freely available. The lack of a common reference simulator does not help the work of researchers and poses limitations on the comparison of results claimed by different research groups. To bridge this gap, herein, the open-source framework LTE-Sim is presented to provide a complete performance verification of LTE networks. LTE-Sim has been conceived to simulate uplink and downlink scheduling strategies in multicell/multiuser environments, taking into account user mobility, radio resource optimization, frequency reuse techniques, the adaptive modulation and coding module, and other aspects that are very relevant to the industrial and scientific communities. The effectiveness of the proposed simulator has been tested and verified considering 1) the software scalability test, which analyzes both memory and simulation time requirements; and 2) the performance evaluation of a realistic LTE network providing a comparison among well-known scheduling strategies.},

This paper makes three original contributions. First, we introduce the concept of cache clouds, which forms the fundamental framework for cooperation among caches in the edge network. Second, we present dynamic hashing-based protocols for document lookups and updates within each cache cloud, which are not only efficient, but also effective in dynamically balancing lookup and update loads among the caches in the cloud. Third, we outline a utility-based mechanism for placing dynamic documents within a cache cloud. Our experiments indicate that these techniques can significantly improve the performance of the edge cache networks},

  Abstract                 = {Cloud computing is fundamentally altering the expectations for how and when computing, storage and networking resources should be allocated, managed and consumed. End-users are increasingly sensitive to the latency of services they consume. Service Developers want the Service Providers to ensure or provide the capability to dynamically allocate and manage resources in response to changing demand patterns in real-time. Ultimately, Service Providers are under pressure to architect their infrastructure to enable real-time end-to-end visibility and dynamic resource management with fine grained control to reduce total cost of ownership while also improving agility. The current approaches to enabling real-time, dynamic infrastructure are inadequate, expensive and not scalable to support consumer mass-market requirements. Over time, the server-centric infrastructure management systems have evolved to become a complex tangle of layered systems designed to automate systems administration functions that are knowledge and labor intensive. This expensive and non-real time paradigm is ill suited for a world where customers are demanding communication, collaboration and commerce at the speed of light. Thanks to hardware assisted virtualization, and the resulting decoupling of infrastructure and application management, it is now possible to provide dynamic visibility and control of services management to meet the rapidly growing demand for cloud-based services. What is needed is a rethinking of the underlying operating system and management infrastructure to accommodate the ongoing transformation of the data center from the traditional server-centric architecture model to a cloud or network-centric model. This paper proposes and describes a reference model for a network-centric datacenter infrastructure management stack that borrows and applies key concepts that have enabled dynamism, scalability, reliability and security in the telecom industry, to the computing industry. Finally- - , the paper will describe a proof-of-concept system that was implemented to demonstrate how dynamic resource management can be implemented to enable real-time service assurance for network centric datacenter architecture.2010},

  Abstract                 = {Data communications are essential in today's economy and most of enterprises rely on a fast and reliable Internet connection to control their production or sales. However, the cost of maintaining Internet connectivity is not negligible, as it requires manpower and capital immobilization. In order to limit the cost of data communications as well as to improve their flexibility, Network-as-a-Service (NaaS) has been proposed. The concept of NaaS is to outsource to the Cloud networking operations like load balancing or firewall. In this paper, we propose a technique based on the Locator/Identifier Separation Protocol (LISP) to allow enterprise networks to effectively outsource their network operations to the Cloud.},

abstract={Recently, Cloud-based Mobile Augmentation (CMA) approaches have gained remarkable ground from academia and industry. CMA is the state-of-the-art mobile augmentation model that employs resource-rich clouds to increase, enhance, and optimize computing capabilities of mobile devices aiming at execution of resource-intensive mobile applications. Augmented mobile devices envision to perform extensive computations and to store big data beyond their intrinsic capabilities with least footprint and vulnerability. Researchers utilize varied cloud-based computing resources (e.g., distant clouds and nearby mobile nodes) to meet various computing requirements of mobile users. However, employing cloud-based computing resources is not a straightforward panacea. Comprehending critical factors (e.g., current state of mobile client and remote resources) that impact on augmentation process and optimum selection of cloud-based resource types are some challenges that hinder CMA adaptability. This paper comprehensively surveys the mobile augmentation domain and presents taxonomy of CMA approaches. The objectives of this study is to highlight the effects of remote resources on the quality and reliability of augmentation processes and discuss the challenges and opportunities of employing varied cloud-based resources in augmenting mobile devices. We present augmentation definition, motivation, and taxonomy of augmentation types, including traditional and cloud-based. We critically analyze the state-of-the-art CMA approaches and classify them into four groups of distant fixed, proximate fixed, proximate mobile, and hybrid to present a taxonomy. Vital decision making and performance limitation factors that influence on the adoption of CMA approaches are introduced and an exemplary decision making flowchart for future CMA approaches are presented. Impacts of CMA approaches on mobile computing is discussed and open challenges are presented as the future research directions.},
