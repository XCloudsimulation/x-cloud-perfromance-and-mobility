\subsection{Mobility}
As \ues{} traverse the \xcloud{} network, the service(s) they subscribe to will migrate to accommodate the changing distribution of \ues{} in the network. The 2-dimensional, multi modal, mobility model detailed in \cite{bettstetter2001smooth} provides us with a uniform distribution of users, with a realistic rate of mobility.

The model defines the fundamental timing and mobility properties of \ue{} movement, such as the speed, acceleration, and direction the \ue{} is moving in, as well as for how long and when in time to turn next.
