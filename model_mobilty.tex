\subsection{Mobility}
As \ac{MD}s traverse the \xcloud{} network domain, the service(s) they subscribe to will migrate to accommodate the changing distribution of \ac{MD}s in the network. The 2-dimensional, multi modal, mobility model detailed in \cite{bettstetter2001smooth} provides us with an on-average uniform distribution of users, with movement proportional to the duration of a session and the scale of the mobile network.

The model defines the fundamental timing and mobility properties of \ac{MD} movement, such as the speed, acceleration, and direction the \ac{MD} is moving in, as well as for how long and when in time to turn next.
