\section{Experiments}
The aforementioned model was implemented in Java employing simjava \cite{SimJava} as the event driven framework. With the constituent models implemented as modules into the event driven framework.

\subsubsection{Service performance and mobility}

In order to reveal the dynamics between the the number of users, placement of the data centres, and the number for services. The simulation is split up into 3 dimensions. To that effect, simulations were performed for a population of \ues{} $N_{ue}$ ranging from 10 to 500 \ues{} at intervals of 10 \ues{}. Additionally, for each run of $N_{ue}$ the number of services $N_{ser}$ and the placement of the data centres was varied. The network spans 9 radio access nodes, $N_{rbs}$.

For each above mentioned simulation scenario, service latency is measured in each \ue{}, and VM migration/duplication resources in the \dc{}.

\subsubsection{VM migration schemes}
For each scenarios the simulation reveals how often the service resides in each \dc{}, how many times one service is started and stopped in each \dc{}, and how how much service latency is incurred by starting and stopping a service throughout the simulation.

\subsubsection{Global parameters and principals}
The \dc{} service time for the ith \dc{} $T_{i,vm}$ is set proportional to the mean request generation rate over the number of \rbss{}, and the number of VMs running on the ith \dc{} $N_{i,vm}$, see Equation \ref{eq:service_time}.

Simulation model parameters used in the experiments can be found in Table \ref{table:simulation_parameters}, likewise the service parameters are declared in Table \ref{table:traffic_parameters}.

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:service_time}
T_{i,j,vm} = K \cdot N_{i,vm} \cdot \frac{ \bar{\lambda}_{sys} }{N_{rbs}}
\end{equation}
